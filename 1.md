1. Start game by backend

- Get random word
- Get number of tries left

2. Frontend receives initial game setup

- Show underscores where letters should be guessed
- User guesses a letter by selecting from predefined letters
- Frontend sends guessed letter to backend

3. Backend receives information from FE

- Evaluate if letter was correct
- If so send back True and the remaining amount of tries
- If not send back False and reduce remaining tries by one
- If the amount of tries is 0, the game is over
