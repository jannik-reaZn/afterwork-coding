A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
A picture is worth a thousand words
Her expression said it allâ€”a picture is worth a thousand words
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
All that glitters is not gold
Beggars can't be choosers
Better safe than sorry
Birds of a feather flock together
Blood is thicker than water
Curiosity killed the cat
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
It's better to give than to receive
Necessity is the mother of invention
Practice makes perfect
Rome wasn't built in a day
Slow and steady wins the race
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
The pen is mightier than the sword
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Time waits for no one
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two wrongs don't make a right
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When there's smoke, there's fire
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't have your cake and eat it too
